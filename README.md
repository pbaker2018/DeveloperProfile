This is a simple one-page non-functional Android App that helped me with my understanding of using 'Constraints' in Android Studio.

The App uses Kotlin to 'round the corners' of one of the logos.

There is a layout for use on all phones, and an XL layout for tablets.

Android will automatically select the XL layout if a tablet is running the app.
